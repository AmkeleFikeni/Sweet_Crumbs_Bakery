    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Sweet Crumbs Bakery was founded in 2018 by <strong>Annabelle Collado</strong>, 
      a self-taught baker with a passion for creating joy through desserts.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe in the value of homemade, crafted, quality baked goods. Not only do they warm the home, 
      but our products will definitely warm the heart. Our favorite time of day is when our first 
      batch comes out of the oven early in the morning, and the fresh smell fills the entire air.
      We like to keep it simple and emphasize taste over flash. Come check out what we’ve got 
      prepared for you today. Your tummy will be happy and we know you will too.
    </p>
